# Sublime-Java-REPL

This is not my original work, I simple configured Sublime REPL to accomodate [BeanShell](http://www.beanshell.org), a lightweight Java scripting tool.

## Installation:

### OSX:

- Install Java SDK;
- Download this folder;
- Open Sublime Text: Preference ->Browser Packages... ->SublimeREPL/config
- Copy folder ./Java to config
- Copy bsh-2.0b4.jar into /Library/Java/Extensions/
- Done!

If necessary, I will try to develop a package to install and update bsh automatically.
